# dotskit

`dotskit` is the command-line tool of [DotNetSolutionKit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SawKing.DotNetSolutionKit),
the `dotnet new` template of .NET microservice solutions. It makes a solution with the template, adds services
to it and flags to its services, and upgrades it to a newer version of the template. Where the team and the
template changed the same file, it merges the two the way git merges branches.

**Documentation, in English and Russian: [dnsk.sawking.tech](https://dnsk.sawking.tech/docs.html#dotskit)**

## Install

```bash
dotnet tool install -g SawKing.DotsKit.Tool
```

dotskit X.Y.Z generates with the template X.Y.Z, which it installs from NuGet into a hive of its own;
the template installed with `dotnet new install` is left as it is.

## Commands

```bash
# in an empty folder: a solution with its first service
dotskit new -N MyCompany -P MyProduct -S Orders

# in the solution: one more service, with the solution's names, database and deployment
dotskit new -S Billing --Storage true

# in the solution: a flag for a service it has
dotskit new -S Orders --MongoDB true

# in a solution made with the template alone: describe it in its manifest
dotskit init

# in a solution: bring it to the tool's version of the template
dotskit upgrade
```

Every command shows the files it will change and why, and asks before writing; `--yes` writes without asking.
It writes all files or none, then builds the solution. A conflict is marked
`<<<<<<< solution` / `>>>>>>> template` and the command exits with 2.

What a solution was made from is kept in `.dotskit/manifest.json`: commit it with the solution.

The template works without the tool; this package is the way to keep a solution up with it.
