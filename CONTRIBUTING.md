## Branches

- `dev` is where the work goes. Every change reaches it through a pull request; it takes no direct pushes.
- `master` is the last release. It takes only the release pull request from `dev`, and a patch for the
  release when one cannot wait for the next.
- `2.x` is the .NET 8 line once 3.0 is out: its fixes go there through pull requests, until support for
  .NET 8 ends on 10 November 2026.

## Changes

A pull request into `dev` publishes nothing, so a small one is fine. Each pull request waits for a full run
of the checks, though, so it pays either to put related pieces of work into one pull request, or to keep
several pull requests going at once and work on one while the checks of another run.

- The pull request runs [template.yml](.github/workflows/template.yml): it generates a solution for each
  combination of flags, builds it, runs its tests and scans it for secrets. It has to be green before the
  merge.
- What the change generates has to be green too, and template.yml checks that as well. In the
  combinations with `--GitHubCiCd` it runs the workflows the solution ships - `ci.yml` with its test
  servers, integration tests and coverage threshold, `secret-scan.yml`, `api-diff.yml` - with
  [scripts/run-workflow.py](scripts/run-workflow.py), on the runner and nothing published. That their
  `uses:` steps run on GitHub itself is what the `nightly` branch of
  [DotNetSolutionKit.Samples](https://github.com/sawking-tech/DotNetSolutionKit.Samples) shows: it is
  regenerated from `dev` the day after `dev` moves, and its CI runs then.
- A change in what a generated solution does comes with a test of that behaviour in the template's tests.
- A change to a workflow of this repository is run on a temporary branch first, for each case it
  handles - the one that succeeds and each one that refuses - before its pull request: a workflow that
  does not work never reaches `dev`, let alone `master`. A rehearsal publishes nothing.
- `dev` carries the next minor version with the label `-rc` in [version.json](version.json), as `2.8.0-rc`,
  and one entry of release notes for it. A change a user of the template sees adds a line to that entry, in
  the same commit, and leaves the number alone; a change that breaks solutions of the current major version
  and comes without a short way to update them makes it the next major, `3.0.0-rc`, with the update
  described in [upgrading](docs/getting-started/upgrading.md). The release notes name what the version is
  about, for whoever decides to update, in a sentence each; they are not a log of every change. The details
  are in the commits and the documentation, the steps to update in upgrading.
- Documentation and the site (`docs/`, `index.html`, `docs.html`, `site/`) change in the same pull request
  as what they describe. The site is published from `master` by [site.yml](.github/workflows/site.yml),
  which promote.yml starts once master has moved; it writes the notes of the released versions from
  `version.json` into `index.html`, so the site describes the released version.

## Releases

The template follows semantic versioning. Its version and release notes are in `version.json`, in the same
shape as a generated solution's ([ADR-004](docs/adr/004-product-version-by-hand.md)).

What `master` receives is published: the GitHub release, the package on nuget.org and in GitHub Packages.
A release comes about once a week, at the end of a sprint, when the work done is worth one, and only
then:

- inside the template: `template.yml` is green on the last commit of `dev`;
- outside it: `nightly` in DotNetSolutionKit.Samples is regenerated from that commit, and its CI is green;
- the batch is finished: nothing begun and left undone is in `dev`.

Before the release, one commit on `dev` takes the label off: `2.8.0-rc` becomes `2.8.0`, and so does its
entry of notes; [promote.yml](.github/workflows/promote.yml) refuses a version that still has it, and the
site shows no labelled version. The minor version grows by exactly one from release to release. The notes
have a headline about what matters most to a user of the template, and lines checked against the commits
since the last release. After the release, `dev` takes the next minor with the label.

The release is then one pull request from `dev` into `master`.

Merged into `master`, it makes [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) tag `v<version>`, wait for
`template.yml` on that commit and publish: the GitHub release with the version's notes
(`scripts/release-notes.sh <version>` prints the same text), the package
`DotNetSolutionKit.Templates.csproj` packs, attached to the release, on nuget.org as
`SawKing.DotNetSolutionKit` and in GitHub Packages. A version on nuget.org cannot be deleted, only
unlisted. DotNetSolutionKit.Samples regenerates its release branches from the new tag within a day.

A patch version is only for a fix that cannot wait for the next release. If `dev` can be released as it is -
what is new in it is finished or behind a flag - the fix goes into `dev` and `dev` is released. If it
cannot, the fix is a pull request into `master` that raises the patch version, as `2.7.1`, with its own
notes; once released, `master` is merged into `dev`. A gap in patch versions is allowed.

A fix of the .NET 8 line is a pull request into `2.x`; `2.x` releases `2.*` versions only, and their GitHub
release is not marked latest.
