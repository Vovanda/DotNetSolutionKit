# DotNetSolutionKit (dotskit)

**DotNetSolutionKit (dotskit)** is a configurable `dotnet new` template and lifecycle toolkit for standardized .NET solutions.

It provides ready-to-use architectural building blocks, modules, and integrations with infrastructure services that can be combined through flags to create different solution variants tailored to a team's needs and infrastructure. It generates microservice solutions based on DDD and Clean Architecture, with CI, deployment, and testing, adds services, connects modules to them, and upgrades solutions to new template versions while preserving the team's code. The generated solution remains an ordinary .NET project owned by the team, allowing them to focus on the architecture of the solution they are building and its business logic.

## Install

```bash
dotnet new install SawKing.DotNetSolutionKit
```

## Generate

```bash
# the shared Common projects, the solution file and the first service
dotnet new DotNetSolutionKit -N MyCompany -P MyProduct -S Orders --Solution

# every further service
dotnet new DotNetSolutionKit -N MyCompany -P MyProduct -S Billing
```

Generated solutions, regenerated from every release with their CI running:
[DotNetSolutionKit.Samples](https://dnsk.sawking.tech/samples.html).

## dotskit

The template's command-line tool, [SawKing.DotsKit.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SawKing.DotsKit.Tool),
adds a service or a flag to a solution it has and upgrades a solution to a newer version of the template,
keeping the team's changes by a three-way merge:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g SawKing.DotsKit.Tool
dotskit new -N MyCompany -P MyProduct -S Orders   # a solution with its first service
dotskit new -S Billing --Storage true              # one more service
dotskit init                                       # describe a solution made with the template alone
dotskit upgrade                                    # bring a solution to the tool's version
```

## Versions

Version 2 targets .NET 8. To install a given version:

```bash
dotnet new install SawKing.DotNetSolutionKit::2.8.0
```

Do not apply version 2 with `--force` over a solution generated from version 1: namespaces, project references,
package management and the shape of error responses changed. What changed and how to carry it over:
[versions of the template](https://dnsk.sawking.tech/docs.html#upgrading). What each release brings:
[releases](https://github.com/sawking-tech/DotNetSolutionKit/releases).
